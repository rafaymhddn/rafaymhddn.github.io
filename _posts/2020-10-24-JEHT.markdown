In this study, the influence of nanofluid for heat enhancement is numerically investigated at **micro scale** for meeting cooling requiremnt of advanced electronic devices. Different concentrations of alumina oxideâ€“water nanofluid are introduced through small jets in crossflow stream over macro pin finned channels.
