In this study, the influence of nanofluid and finns for heat enhancement is numerically investigated at **macro scale** for meeting cooling requiremnt of advanced electronic devices. Different concentrations of alumina oxide–water nanofluid are introduced through small jets in crossflow stream over finned channels.
