In this study the influence of nanofluid and finns for heat enhancement is numerically investigated at **macro scale** for meeting cooling requiremnt of advanced electronic devices. Different concentration of alumina oxideâ€“water nanofluid are introduced through small jets in crossflow stream over finned channels.
